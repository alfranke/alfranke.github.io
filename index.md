## About me
I’m a semiconductor scientist focused on the engineering of optoelectronic and photonic devices for next generation light emitters for communication, sensing, and imaging applications as well as single photon sources required for quantum cryptography and quantum computing. My research activities at forefront university institutions in Germany and the United States and collaboration with cutting edge international companies and research institutions allowed me to developed profound expertise covering multidisciplinary fields - crystal and thin film deposition, nanotechnology, semiconductor device simulation, fabrication and their structural and optical characterization.
My current work is focused on the fabrication and fundamental research on nitride vertical emitting ultra-violet lasers qualified for a weak and strong interaction of light with matter.

## Interests and projects
* nitride and oxide thin films and photonic devices for sensing, imaging and quantum communication technology (single photon emitter, quantum cryptography)
* nanostructures especially for tailoring and emission of light (microcavity laser, photonic crystals, micro-disk laser)
* light-matter interaction in photonic structures (photon and polariton lasing, Bose-Einstein condensation, polariton physics and thereon based applications - polariton laser)
* semiconductor device characterization using luminescence and photometric techniques including spatial, time, temperature dependent photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy, electro luminescence
* electron microscopy and combined methods of structural and luminescence measurement techniques (cathodoluminescence spectroscopy)
* development of unique custom-build measurement equipment
* vacuum- and cryogenic technology for spectroscopic applications
