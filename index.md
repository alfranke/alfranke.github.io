## About me
Iâ€™m a semiconductor scientist with passion in photonics. My endeavors are focused on the engineering of optoelectronic and photonic devices to provide the next generation light sources tailored to communication, sensing, and lighting applications as well as single photon emitters required for quantum cryptography and quantum computing. My research activities at forefront university institutions in Germany and the United States and collaboration with cutting edge international companies and research institutions allowed me to developed profound expertise covering multidisciplinary fields - crystal growth and thin film deposition, nanotechnology, semiconductor device simulation, fabrication and their structural and optical characterization.
My current work is focused on the development and fundamental research on nitride vertical emitting ultra-violet lasers qualified for a weak and strong interaction of light with matter.

## Interests and projects
* nitride and oxide thin films and thereon based photonic devices for sensing, illumination and quantum communication technology (single photon emitter, quantum cryptography) 
* nanostructures especially for emission and tailoring of light (microcavity laser, photonic crystals, micro-disk laser)
* light-matter interaction in photonic structures (photon and polariton lasing, Bose-Einstein condensation, polariton physics)
* semiconductor device characterization - especially luminescence and photometric techniques including spatial, time, temperature dependent photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy, electro luminescence
* electron microscopy and combined methods of structural and luminescence characterization techniques (cathodoluminescence spectroscopy)
* development of unique custom-build measurement equipment
* cryogenic and vacuum technology
