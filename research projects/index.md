## 2014 â€“ 2016 Nitride ultra-violet surface emitting laser
Intended to an emission wavelength of 270 nm in the UV-C spectral range Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) and microcavity lasers qualified to operate in the weak or strong light matter coupling regime were fabricated. After the design and simulation, structures based on Aluminum-Nitride (AlN) and the ternary alloy Aluminum-Gallium-Nitride (AlGaN) were grown using metal organic vapor phase deposition. High reflectance Bragg mirrors, hybrid and monolithic epitaxial microcavities were achieved by applying strain engineering schemes and the development of a new patented method of polarity controlled growth. Final structures were characterized facilitating structural (X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy) and optical (Photorefelctometry, photoluminescence) measurement techniques. Based on the achieved improvements on the AlGaN crystalline quality and monolayer precise epitaxy of DBR and QW nanostructures concepts for the fabrication of ultra-low threshold UV-C polariton laser devices were demonstrated.
